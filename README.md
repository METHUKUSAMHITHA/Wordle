# Wordle

Let's play the word guessing game! You will have 6 attempts to guess the word.

Here's how it works:

Each guess should contain 5 letters.
After providing a guess, press the enter key.
I will use color codes to provide feedback on your guesses:
A correct letter in the correct spot will be colored in green.
A correct letter in the wrong spot will be colored in yellow.
An incorrect letter will be colored in gray.
Now that you know the rules, go ahead and start by giving me a word to guess, or let me know if you have any other questions.
